Notes:  User needs to put in his location information before running in Sites section, and comment
out my sites. 
All items display future information.  That means if one runs the program after a body rises, the
rise time will be for the following day, not today.  That is true for all items listed.  Items in 
current section are for the current time.

I am still working on getting Jupiter's moons right, so it is not working as of this version.
